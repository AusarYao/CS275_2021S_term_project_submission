            This project furthers the research about symbiosis described in Dr Peter Turney’s paper <a href="https://direct.mit.edu/artl/article/26/3/338/93245/Symbiosis-Promotes-Fitness-Improvements-in-the" style="border: none;">Symbiosis Promotes Fitness Improvements in the Game of Life</a>. Using a variant of Conway’s Game of Life called Immigration Game, we can test the fitness of organisms. Organisms are configurations of live cells adhering to the simple rules of Game of Life. Seeds are initial configurations of these live cells within an organism. They are analogous to genomes. Seeds compete against each other to determine fitness.

The hope is that seeds evolve through reproduction and evolution by natural selection, just as in biological organisms, to a point that life as we know it emerges. Turney’s simulations demonstrate that evolution can be promoted through symbiosis by joining organisms for mutual benefit. However, it is unknown how far this evolution will go and whether even basic life can emerge. Is evolution unbounded with the reproduction mechanisms and symbiosis that Dr Turney has devised? Far more generations have to be computed to determine this. Unfortunately, this requires too much computational resources.
